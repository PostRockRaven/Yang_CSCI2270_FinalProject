#Final Project

##Project Summary:
Our project will have the user search for movies to rent from his home. To do this, we will create several binary trees of each store (RedBox, Blockbuster, DVD Stop, Barnes&Noble, Super Awesome Taiwan Rentals, etc.) which will have the prices of individual movies. The user will also input the current gas price and efficency. When the user enters the movie, we will output the distance between his location and the movie store, and return the total lowest price. For example, he will enter

```  
  Movie: Shawshank Redemption
  Gas price: 2.68
  Fuel Efficency: 20mil/gallon
```
And the program will output the top three cheapest total prices (price of DVD plus transportation) as well as the distance from the user's home. In the case of identical total prices, the store that is closer will be listed first.
  
```  
  Redbox: $3.17, 5 miles.
  Super Awesome Taiwan Rentals: $3.90, 3 miles.
  Blockbuster: $3.90, 6 miles.
```
