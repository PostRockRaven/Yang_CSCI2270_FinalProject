#Final Project

##Project Summary:
Our project will have the user search for movies to rent from his home. We will also create a graph of various areas where he can rent the movie (RedBox, Blockbuster, DVD Stop, Barnes&Noble, Super Awesome Taiwan Rentals, etc.) The user will also input the current gas price and efficency. When the user enters the movie, we will output the distance between his location and the movie store, and return the total lowest price. For example, he will enter

```  
  Movie: Shashank Redemption
  Gas price: 2.68
  Fuel Efficency: 20mil/gallon
```
And the program will output the top three cheapest prices as well as the distance from the user's home.
  
```  
  Redbox: $3.17, 5 miles.
  Super Awesome Taiwan Rentals: $3.90, 3 miles.
  Blockbuster: $3.90, 6 miles.
```
